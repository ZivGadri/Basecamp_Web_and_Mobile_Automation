## Basecamp Web & Mobile App Automation Testing Project

### This project is a Selenium / Appium automation Maven project created as an automation course final project. This project was built in a page object design pattern with Java, containing several Sanity tests and combines the use of a remote DB for writeing and reading information. The whole git management was made through the git bash.  

#### Basecamp is a project management tool which has a web application, as well as a mobile app. In this project I will test both platforms individualy and integrated.


Web tests are to be executed localy for now through the ExecuteWebSanity.xml. This file contains parameters which are crutial for initialization.
Allure reporting system is connected. In order to view the tests results we can either do it from the idea terminal, or a simple command line using the command 'allure serve allure-results' while in the project's directory.
