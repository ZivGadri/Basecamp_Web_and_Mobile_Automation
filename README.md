# Basecamp Web & Mobile App Automation Testing Project

## This project is a Selenium / Appium automation Maven project created as an automation course final project. This project was built in a page object design pattern with Java, containing several Sanity tests and combines the use of a remote DB for writeing and reading information. The whole git management was made thru the git bash.  

### Basecamp is a project management tool which has a web application, as well as a mobile app. In this project I will test both platforms individualy and integrated.
